  <br/>

<p align="justify">I am a postgrad student of Big Data Analytics with over 5 years of professional experience in Banking and various startups focusing on Ed-tech and Marketing.</p>

<p align="justify">Initially, I started with Python, making simple data exploration projects and expanding my knowledge over time. After which, I started to learn Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts with Python libraries like SciKitLearn, Keras, TensorFlow to create predictive models. During this time I also started with my Analytics post graduate program and learned Big Data tools like Apache hadoop with Hive and Pig for web scraping and Business Intelligence tools like Tableau, Power BI and IBM Cognos. I am currently looing for a role wherein I can contribute my business as well as technical knowledge to gain insights out of raw data.</p>

<p align="justify">Over the last year, my knowledge and experience with Business Intelligence tools have expanded, as has my interest. I am proficient in using Tableau and Power BI with Python and SQL environment, as well as Google Cloud Platform. I also have a solid understanding of Mathematics and Statistics, and am able to work with large and complex datasets. My goal with data analytics, visualization and Reportin is to help others. I enjoy being able to create something that stakeholders can use to make their desions easier and data driven </p>
